# Vehicle-Routing-Python

This project focuses on solving the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) using three distinct algorithms: a greedy algorithm, an optimized version, and a genetic algorithm.

## Greedy Algorithm

The simple greedy algorithm is implemented in the [`greedy.py`](greedy.py) file. The solution generated by this algorithm is stored in a file named [`greedy_solution.txt`](greedy_solution.txt) .

## Optimized Solution

To enhance the solution, an optimization technique is applied by introducing a 'dropout chance.' This probability determines whether some vehicles are excluded in each round. By testing multiple variants of the greedy solution through iterative runs, an optimised solution can be identified. This technique reduces the total cost by approximately 6%, particularly with a dropout chance of 20%.

## Genetic Algorithm

The genetic algorithm, implemented in the [`genetic.py`](genetic.py) file, employs multiple random swaps (mutations) to refine the solution.

It's worth noting that attempts to improve the solution by introducing a number of random swaps between nodes did not yield any significant reduction in cost. One interpretation could be that the greedy algorithm is already quite close to the optimal solution compared to a random solution.
